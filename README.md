# Elysium Puzzle Engine

This engine was created with the purpose of simulating combinatorical strategies for variations of the 15-Puzzle problem in C++. 
It was implemented as a coursework assignment during October of 2019, whilst I was undergoing my MSc at Newcastle University.

## Features 

As I progress through the creation of this project, I will continuously update this section with the implemented functionality.

### Research Papers Utilized 

### C++ Resources

I will be adding resources in here as this project progresses.

### External Tools

#### [Premake](https://premake.github.io/)

I have used premake as my build versioning tool as it allows me to easily and dynamically create different configuration projects to meet my build option requirements, as well as neatly structure the project files.

#### [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)

I have used Google Test for Unit Testing my application as it allows me to seemlessly integrate unit testing into my working environment, I plan to continuously integrate new Unit Tests for any additional functionality which I implement during this project's lifetime.
